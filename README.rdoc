A app to track all your comps at casinos in Atlantic City. For my retired parents. 

Basically creating a webscraper that logs into all these casino rewards accounts, and retrieves all the comp info,
then parses the dates so it can send you an email when something is about to expire.

Currently uses Watir-Webdriver w/ phantomjs. It's working, but sort of iffy. 

Going to try Capybara w/ Poltergeist when I try again.
