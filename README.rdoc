A app to track all your comps at casinos in Atlantic City. For my retired parents. 

Basically creating a webscraper that logs into all these casino rewards accounts, and retrieves all the comp info,
then parses the dates so it can send you an email when something is about to expire.

Currently uses Watir-Webdriver w/ phantomjs. It's working, but sort of iffy. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
	1. USERS -> username(email) + password (has_secure_password)
	   has_many -> accounts
	   
	   create - email + password + password confirmation
	   + email confirmation to create user
	
	
	
	 2. ACCOUNTS -> login + password (has_secure_password)
		belongs_to -> users
	
		create acounts must only be available to current_user
		
		
TODO:

1. Some questions:

	- how do you use ENV variables to hide important stuff?
	- how do you use web workers? - RESQUE?
